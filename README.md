This is my webpage project using Tailwind. The main purpose of the project was to use this tool to practice my skills in frontend development. CSS can be quite tricky when used in large projects. Tailwind comes to make things cleaner and more effective. I also added some Javascript functions to make things more dynamic. This project was made according to my Udemy Course about Tailwind.

## Responsivity
This project helped me learn about responsivity. Tailwind brings responsivity in a easier way. I used this in the CSS classes: sm, md and lg. For example, in this peace of code I changed some layout of the page according to its screen resolutions.

````
  <div class="flex flex-col space-y-10 mb-44 lg:mt-16
             lg:w-1/2 xl:mb-52">
                <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-center lg:text-6xl lg:max-w-md lg:text-left ">
                    More than just shorter links
                </h1>
                <p class="text-2xl text-center text-gray-400 lg:max-w-md lg:text-left">
                    Build your brand's recognition and get detailed insights on how your links are perfoming.
                </p>
                <div class="mx-auto lg:mx-0">
                    <a href="#" class="py-5px px-10 text-2xl font-bold text-white bg-cyan rounded-full lg:py-4 hover:opacity-70">
                        Get Started
                    </a>
                </div>
</div>
